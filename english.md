"I would like to point out that the existing BCS theory, which interprets superconductivity, is incorrect."

In the late 1980s, the world's scientific community was seized with a fever for superconductivity. Following the computer revolution, scientists overwhelmingly endorsed "superconductivity" as a scientific revolution that would culminate the 20th century. This was because the development of superconductors could address the pressing issue of energy, a challenge faced by humanity.

Superconductivity is a phenomenon where current flows without resistance. Most materials exhibit superconductivity when their temperature is brought close to absolute zero (-273°C). The challenge, however, is not achieving such low temperatures but developing a material that can induce superconductivity at relatively higher temperatures.

In 1911, Onnes of the Netherlands discovered superconductivity in mercury (at absolute temperature 4K), but for 75 years afterward, the critical temperature (the temperature at which superconductivity occurs) remained at 19K.

In this context, a groundbreaking discovery was made in 1986 at IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory by Bednorz and Müller. They created a lanthanum-barium-copper oxide compound that induced superconductivity near 30K. Afterward, the critical temperature rapidly increased for 3-4 years. By the end of '86, it reached 40K, and by early '87, yttrium-based oxides were reported to have been discovered by Dr. Chu of the University of Houston, reaching 90K.

Limitations of BCS Theory
In January '88, Japan announced a superconductor surpassing 100K, and around the same time, at the World Superconductivity Conference, a titanium-based oxide showing superconductivity at 125K was revealed.

Domestic universities and research institutes also reported the discovery of superconductors where electrical resistance disappears around 100K. However, suddenly, this fever cooled in the 1990s. Why?

Professor Choi Dong-sik of the Chemistry Department at Korea University argues that this was because a proper understanding of superconductivity had not been established. We met with Professor Choi, who is leading the research on next-generation superconductors, to breathe new life into the stagnant field of superconductivity research.

*"I heard that you're finalizing a book on new superconductivity research at the end of September. What's the difference between existing superconductivity research and your newly completed research?"*

"Before discussing the differences, I'd like to explain why existing superconductivity research has hit a wall. As you may know, the basic theory that explains superconductivity is BCS theory. Specifically, Cooper's theory that electrons must pair to induce superconductivity has dominated researchers, and I would like to point out that this is incorrect."

*"Didn't Cooper win a Nobel Prize in '72 for this theory?"*

"Yes, he did. But if electrons pair, the magnetic susceptibility should be zero. However, in the situation that induces superconductivity, it is not zero. Also, electrons do not actually pair in real space. They only have the same momentum and energy values in momentum space."

50 years after the emergence of BCS theory, a theory that more broadly explained superconductivity appeared in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. However, after BCS won the Nobel Prize in 1972, other theories lost momentum. Professor Choi explains that the Cold War atmosphere may have distorted the direction of scholarship.

*"What are the features of your new superconductivity theory?"*

"Superconductivity requires low entropy. However, even when you lower the temperature, electrons do not easily reduce entropy. The way is in the location and momentum, and the movement "We should standardize the form, and the most ideal thing is to make a uniform movement like dividing the army. In other words, it means that it must be confined in a narrow space and only vibrated in place. This concept is 'collective oscillation'. At first, I thought I was the one who first established the concept of group vibration, but when I looked back at the literature these days, I found that it had already been used by Galasiewicz in Flanders." (Translators Note: Likely “Zygmunt M. Galasiewicz Professor of Physics, Wrocław, Poland author of Superconductivity and Quantum Fluids. 1970)


Professor Choi was looking for Poland's Galasiewicz and his former Soviet mentor N. Bogoliubov (Translators note: likely Nikolay Bogolyubov, Soviet Physicist), who in 1970 led to the same conclusion as himself. 

*So is Professor Choi's theory a mere rediscovery?*

"No, it's not. The next step is even more important, not the end of collective vibrations. When an electron is oscillating collectively, it moves one step at a time when electrons flow in from outside, but this time it is tunneling as a wave, not as a particle. In other words, the electron takes on the nature of a wave when the temperature is low, its position is limited, and its mass is very small. The BCS theory saw the movement of electrons as particles, but I see it as a wave. It's a kind of quantum mechanical perspective."

Adding to this, Professor Choi's theory understands the flow of electrons in superconductivity not as a gaseous flow but as a liquid flow. Common sense would say that liquids have greater viscosity than gases, so it's easy to have a gaseous perspective when superconductivity occurs, but under identical conditions (same pressure, same temperature, same density), liquids are less viscous, he argues. In summary, the explanation is that when the flow of electrons is perceived as a liquid wave phenomenon, the resistance becomes zero.

Professor Choi explained that anyone specializing in quantum statistical mechanics or fluid theory would have come to the same conclusion if they participated in superconductivity research. In fact, at a symposium held in Los Alamos in 1989, masters of theoretical physics gathered and called electrons inside superconductors liquid. In Korea, too, people like Dr. Jo Soon-tak are supporting the liquid theory.

*So, as a result of theoretical errors, you're saying that today's superconductor research has hit a wall?*

"That's right. But there seems to be a slight misunderstanding. Superconductor researchers know well that the BCS theory cannot explain high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, many scholars are studying high-temperature superconductors, regardless of BCS. But with high-temperature superconductor development pouring in here and there, there is a problem that the United States and Japan are selecting only those that satisfy one framework. This is what I explained earlier as the framework barrier. For example, the Meissner effect (a phenomenon where superconductors exhibit diamagnetism when magnetized) is listed in the framework as a requirement for a superconductor, but I think it is hindering superconductor research."

When the reporter met him for the third time, he finally gave a simple example to explain his theory. He continued, "If it's the most ideal superconductor, it should have a high critical temperature, high critical current, and large critical magnetic field. But reality isn't so. Ultimately, we only need to increase the parts that can be increased according to the need. If you want to use a superconductor in a transmission line, it's enough to have a high critical current and high critical temperature.

There's no need to increase the critical magnetic field. When using a superconductor in a supercomputer, only a very small current flows, so there is no need to worry about the critical current."

His theory is that if a superconductor is developed to suit its purpose, the development of superconductors can grow rapidly.

Currently, Professor Choi is preparing patents for about ten superconductors that match his theory. Many of these were discovered by others but were discarded because they did not fit the so-called quasi-framework.

According to the new superconductor theory, many previously ignored superconductors will be revitalized. If the development of superconductors so far was similar to an alchemist accidentally creating precious gems, now we can almost perfectly prove experimentally what phenomena occur when certain materials are treated in a certain way. We can also explain why it was ignored because it wasn't reproducible. In other words, diagnoses and prescriptions have become certain according to need."

*Have you ever discussed this theory with other scholars in Korea?*

"I've discussed it with all scholars related to superconductivity. Among them, we felt that the barriers between disciplines are severe. If it's not a method they are familiar with, they are not easily accepted. But many are actively helping. To see the light of the new superconductor theory, people from various fields such as physical chemistry, metals, electronics, materials, chemical engineering must come together for organized research, and many people in each field have been agreeing with my opinions. Currently, we are organizing a new concept superconductivity research group, where 20 people from academia, 5 from research institutes, and 5 from industry will participate."

*Please introduce the people who are actively researching with you.*

"There are Professor Park Sung-ho of Korea University's Department of Electronics, Professor Lee Hong-hee of Seoul National University's Department of Chemical Engineering, Attorney Kwon Dong-yong (Ph.D. in Chemistry), Dr. Byun Jong-hong of KIST's Solid Chemistry Laboratory, Dr. Kim Yoon-ho of the Fluid Electroceramics Laboratory, Dr. Heo Nam-hee of the Standard Research Institute's Superconductivity Office, Deputy Director Hong Yang-gi of Dongyang Chemical Research Institute, etc., and many professors and researchers are watching with interest. I have great expectations for non-traditional physicists like Won Hye-young of Hallym University, No Tae-won of Seoul National University, Lim Kook-hyung of Chungnam National University, and Professor Yoo Jae-jun of Sogang University."

*If this superconductor research bears fruit, you emphasized that it will greatly contribute to the development of science and technology in our country...*

"Not just the development of science and technology. It will be a great economic success. The application of superconductors includes energy, communication, computers, medical, transportation, etc., where it is hardly unused. Think about us taking the lead in such research. In this sense, the government's active support is desperately needed."

*Have you ever thought about something like a Nobel Prize with this theory?*

"Well, the Nobel Prize has already been awarded four times in the field of superconductivity, and they are all in physics. Maybe once it could be in chemistry."

*Do you have any thoughts on presenting this theory in a prestigious international journal?*

“I'll have to do it after it appears in ‘Science Donga’. I often say that I am a person who does Eastern science. How could such a person look for foreign authoritative journals from the beginning?"

The beginning of Professor Choi's superconductivity research was when he was lecturing on special physical chemistry to students, emphasizing the characteristics of Eastern science and saying "let's go into electrons to understand natural phenomena." This idea has led to the present day.
